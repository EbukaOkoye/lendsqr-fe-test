# Login page
The login page is a simple one. It is responsive and on clicking on the submit button it re-directs you to the dashboard page.

# Dashboard page
The dashboard page fetches data from a mock API that has some data in it. The data from the API is quite large , so a pagination logic is done to limit how much data appeaers on the dashboard page. There is also an option to for the status for each data that is deisplayed in the table.

# User Details page
The user detail page just returns the information on the user. The information is stored to the local storage once the user details page loads.
